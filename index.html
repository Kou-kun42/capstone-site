        <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is Panda Printing?</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          The goal of Panda Printing is to extend the tools and resources of 3D
          printing to those who would not have access to it otherwise. 3D
          printing has advanced significantly over the recent years. Users are
          now able to create complex shapes and structures that were not
          possible in the past with conventional techniques such as wood and
          metalworking, with the added benefit of being low cost. While 3D
          printing has become more affordable, there is still a large learning
          curve required to be able to use and maintain a 3D printer which can
          produce consistent, high quality prints. At Panda Printing, we
          understand that not everyone has the time or capital to invest in
          buying and caring for a 3D printer, and that's OK! Panda Printing is
          designed to quickly and efficiently put this powerful technology into
          the hands of the end user. Check thhe About page to learn more about
          our printing solutions!
